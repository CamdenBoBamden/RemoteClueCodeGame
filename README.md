Remote Family Screen Sharing Game 
### Full game can be played on my website at www.camdencoulter.com

I Made this game in about a day and a half for my sister-in-law who wanted to play a board game with the family for our Sunday night Zoom dinners. I've added just the Html and the JS file from the code here, but you can find the game to play on my website as well. Enjoy!
